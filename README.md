## Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide potential Airbnb hosts with actionable insights into the most profitable neighborhoods in Boston.
This analysis helps investors make informed decisions when choosing where to invest in Airbnb properties, considering factors such as price per night, occupancy rate, and overall potential revenue.

 ## Introduction
Boston is a prime location for Airbnb investments due to its rich history, thriving tourism, and large student population.
However, determining where to invest and how to maximize revenue can be challenging. This dashboard simplifies the process by visualizing key metrics and trends, giving hosts a competitive edge in identifying high-performing locations.

## Structure
This project includes the following components:

- **Data Collection:** The dataset used for this analysis comes from publicly available Airbnb listings in Boston. It includes key details such as price, number of reviews, location, and availability.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Data was cleaned and prepared to ensure consistency and accuracy, removing null values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Analysis & Dashboard Creation:** The analysis was performed using Tableau, and a comprehensive dashboard was built to visualize the data. Key metrics were used to evaluate profitability, such as price per night and occupancy rate.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel:** For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Airbnb Dataset:** Used as the primary source of data for this analysis.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis was obtained from the publicly available Airbnb listings dataset for Boston. The dataset includes variables such as listing price, number of reviews, occupancy rate, and neighborhood.

## Findings Using the Dashboard
- **Total Listings:** There are 5,185 total listings, indicating a robust and diverse Airbnb market in Boston.
- **Occupancy Rate:** The average occupancy rate is 48.02%, suggesting that, on average, listings are occupied for almost half the time. This may point to a market with room for growth in increasing occupancy through marketing or adjusting pricing strategies.
- **Average Daily Rate:** The average daily rate is $230.60, reflecting a healthy price point for Airbnb rentals in Boston, which could make hosting financially viable for property owners.
- **Average Stay Days:** Guests tend to stay for 3 days on average, which is typical for short-term rentals and weekend getaways. This can help hosts plan for quick turnovers.
- **Average Review Scores:** The average review score of 4.753 indicates that guests are highly satisfied with their stays, suggesting a generally high standard of service and experience across Boston listings.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Data shows distinct seasonal trends, with availability score dropping in Sep & Oct, providing insights into the best times to maximize revenue.
- **Property Type Performance:** Listings categorized as "entire rental unit" & "entire home/apt" generally show better performance compared to shared spaces in terms of revenue generation.
- **Neighborhood Profitability:** Certain neighborhoods in Boston, such as Allston, Back Bay, Brighton, Downtown & East Boston were identified as having the highest potential for profit due to a combination of high occupancy rates & revenue generated 
- **Top Hosts by Reviews:** Top Hosts by Reviews: Boris & Susan in East Boston are the most popular hosts by far, with 4,392 reviews, highlighting their success in attracting a large volume of guests. Brian + Heather and Albert, both in Downtown, follow with 2,761 and 2,009 reviews respectively, indicating that Downtown remains a highly active area for Airbnb hosts.
